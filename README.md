### What I'm Currently Learning

I'm currently focused on mastering my skills in advanced Python, Tensorflow, Git, ROS, and C++. I'm working on [Learning_Programing](https://github.com/sepideh-shamsizadeh/Learning_programing) Repository to deepen my understanding of these technologies and apply them to real-world problems.

### Projects

- [Cloud-Registration](https://github.com/sepideh-shamsizadeh/Cloud-Registration/tree/main): Given a source and a target point cloud, find the alignment transformation of the source to the target cloud.
- [Structure from Motion](https://github.com/sepideh-shamsizadeh/3D_structure_from_motion): Developed a Structure from Motion pipeline in a group project, implementing feature extraction and matching as well as incremental 3D reconstruction using C++ and Ceres Solver.
- [PatchMatching](https://github.com/sepideh-shamsizadeh/3D_PatchMatching/tree/master): Implemented Patch Matching algorithm to estimate disparity maps from stereo images, and extended the software with core functionalities such as disparity propagation and random search.
